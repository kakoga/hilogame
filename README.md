HiLo Game is a simple game written in Javascript that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and allows the user 7 chances to guess
the correct number. If the user guesses the randomly generated number, the user wins and the game is over. If the user does not guess
the correct number in 7 tries, then the game is over.
