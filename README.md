# hilogame

This simple game was developed as a part of a pair-programming assignment at LEARN Academy for learning JS.

HiLo Game is a simple game written in Javascript that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and allows the user 7 chances to guess
the correct number. If the user guesses the randomly generated number, the user wins and the game is over. If the user does not guess
the correct number in 7 tries, then the game is over.

After cloning you can execute the code within any browsers' console. Copy all of the code into the console and press 'Enter'. To play the game run the function playGame();
